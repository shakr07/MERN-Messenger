## Overview
# Frontend: 
-React.js is used for building the user interface. React Router is utilized for handling navigation, and state management is handled by Reactâ€™s built-in hooks and possibly other libraries.
# Backend: 
-Node.js with Express.js handles server-side logic and API routes. The applicationâ€™s backend is responsible for user authentication, database interactions, and real-time communication.
# Real-time Communication: 
-WebSockets (through libraries like Socket.io) are used for implementing the real-time messaging feature.
# Database: 
MongoDB serves as the database for storing user data, messages, and other application data. Mongoose is used to interact with MongoDB, providing a structured schema for the data.
